++ dg.sh  - Bash driver for dg_cli

This application generates the output file 'fakedata.dat',
which is a realization of a periodic poisson process.

changing Nbar), although modifying the program parameters
should be fairly easy: Look for the 'make data' subroutine.

The bash script file 'dg.sh' runs the executable 'dg_cli'
with suitable command line arguments. There are variables
here that define the total number of realizations and the
expected number of photons per fringe. All output files are
stored for later use in './fringe_data/'

++ estimate - Estimator for quality of simulation routines

This application generates the output file 'histogram.dat',
which is a 1-1 record of the empirical distribution of
arrivals per simulation period. The data is then tested for
comparison with the factorial moments of the Poisson
distribution. The output of this is given on
'fact_moments.dat'.

Finally, it calculates the phase for every generated fringe and stores it on 'phase.dat'. In the future, this will be followed by an analysis of dispersion.
