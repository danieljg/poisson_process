++ compile.sh - Compilation commands for dg_cli and estimate

Some optimizations have been implemented.
No tests were made regarding these.
============================================================
++ dg_cli - Periodic Poisson process simulator with command
            line interface
++ dg.sh  - Bash driver for dg_cli

This application generates the output file 'fakedata.dat',
which is a realization of a periodic poisson process.

The bash script file 'dg.sh' runs the executable 'dg_cli'
with suitable command line arguments. There are variables
here that define the total number of realizations and the
expected number of photons per fringe. All output files are
compressed for later use in './data/'
===========================================================
++ estimate    - Estimator of phase, contrast and quality 
                 of simulation with command line interface
++ estimate.sh - Bash driver for estimate

This application generates several output files which are
stored on /results/ for later usage. Records of the experi-
ments, along with evaluations of Poissonity are available.

The numerical experiment presently calculates the expected
error of the phase estimation algorithm for an array of
contrasts and mean number of photons.

In the future, this will be followed by a similar analysis
for the contrast estimation.
