++ dg - Periodic Poisson process simulator

This application generates the output file 'fakedata.dat', which is a realization of a periodic poisson process.

No user interface has been coded (no arguments exist for changing Nbar), although modifying the program parameters should be fairly easy: Look for the 'make data' subroutine.

[sorry for the billingual comments]

If ifort is availble, running 'runme.sh' compiles and runs the executable 'dg'. No optimization compiler flags where used (as none where needed really the program runs pretty fast as is).

++ estimate - Estimator for quality of simulation routines

This application generates the output file(s) 'histogram.dat', which is a 1-1 record of the empirical distribution of arrivals per simulation period. The data is then tested for comparison with the factorial moments of the Poisson distribution. The output of this is given on 'fact_moments.dat'.

Finally, it calculates the phase for every generated fringe and stores it on 'phase.dat'. In the future, this will be followed by an analysis of dispersion.
